useless shit

## getting started

### prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- Make (optional, for using the Makefile)

### building

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skibidilang.git
   cd skibidilang
   ```

2. Compile the interpreter:
   ```
   make
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```
   gcc -o skibidilang skibidilang.c -Wall -Wextra -pedantic
   ```

### running

Run the SkibidiLang interpreter:

```
./skibidilang
```

Then enter your SkibidiLang code at the prompt.

## example

Here's a simple SkibidiLang program:

```
DOP x = 5
BRRRR ( x > 0 )
    SKIBIDI x
    DOP x = x - 1
SKBID
SKIBIDI "Done!"
```

This program will print numbers from 5 to 1, then print "Done!".
